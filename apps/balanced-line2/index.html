	<h4>Balanced-line simulation</h4>
	<p>
		Based loosely on the dice game described in Eli Goldratt's "The Goal", this version
		can compare a "perfect" line (no variation in processes) with the more realistic
		case of random breakdowns or delays in processes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The yellow boxes represent operations,	with the count (in blue) being the number of <i>units</i> that were processed in the current <i>tick</i>i>.
		The white boxes represent the number of items available to be processed.
		The actual capacity of an operation to process units may be higher than shown, but is limited by the number of available units.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cyan boxes (to the right of each line) represent cash, which starts at zero.
		Each unit costs $1, incurred when that unit first enters the line.
		Each finished unit earns $2. The simulation runs for 300 ticks, after which we deduct the running costs of $800.
		If the cash is below zero at the end of the run, the line can't pay its bills.

		<h5>Balanced line, zero variation ("perfect")</h5>
		<p>Each operation is able to process exactly 3 units each 'ticks'. Moving of items between operations
		is assumed to be instantaneous.</p>
		<div class="lineDiv"></div>
		<hr />
		<h5>Balanced line, small random variation</h5>
		<p>Each operation is able to process from 2 to 4 units per tick, with a mean of 3.</p>
		<div class="lineDiv"></div>
		<h5>Balanced line, large random variation</h5>
		<p>Each operation is able to process from 0 to 7 units per tick, with a mean of 3.</p>
		<div class="lineDiv"></div>
		<hr />
		<!-- <h5>Unbalanced line, random variation</h5>
		<p>First operation takes two ticks with 50% reliability. The rest take 3 ticks with 75% reliability. Each operation time should average out at 4 ticks.</p>
		<div class="lineDiv"></div>
		<hr /> -->
		<!-- <P>Prediction is that the unbalanced line will perform nearer the ideal than the balanced line, even though the average capacity of all operations is the same.</p> -->
		<P>Prediction is that higher variation will result in less throughput per time, and more WIP, even though the average capacity of all operations is the same.</p>
		<p>TODO: add an <i>unbalanced</i> line with variation, and see how it compares.</p>
