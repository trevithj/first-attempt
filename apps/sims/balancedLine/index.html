	<h4>Balanced-line simulation</h4>
	<p>
		Based loosely on the dice game described in Eli Goldratt's "The Goal", this version
		can compare a "perfect" line (no variation in processes) with the more realistic
		case of random variation in units processed. The simulation runs for 400 time units (ticks)
		and compares performance of various simulated production lines.
	</p>
	<p>
		The yellow boxes represent operations,	with the count (in blue) being the number of <i>units</i> that were processed in the current <i>tick</i>.
		The grey box is the raw material ready to be consumed by the first operation.
		The white boxes represent the number of items available to be processed.
		The actual capacity of an operation to process units may be higher than shown, but is limited by the number of available units.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cyan boxes (to the right of each line) represent cash, which starts at zero.
		The amount of cash at the end of the run is therefore the net profit for that time period.
		Each unit costs $2, incurred when that unit first enters the line.
		The line also incurrs fixed costs of $3 per tick.
		Each finished unit earns $4.
		If the cash (net profit) is below zero at the end of the run, the line can't pay its bills.
	</p>
	<p>
		Moving of items between operations is assumed to be instantaneous.
		Prediction is that higher variation will result in less throughput per time, and more WIP, even though the average capacity of all operations is the same.

		<p>
			The unbalanced line 5 usually has the least capacity of all the lines, due to the first process being more limited.
			But this has the side-effect of limiting the build-up of work-in-process, and so keeps the variable cost of material from rising too high.
			As a result, it tends to have a higher net profit than the previous line 4.
			This despite line 4 having the same variation but greater overall throughput.
